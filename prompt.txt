Through this conversation, I will send a brief description of a scene, with the description, you are to write a prompt and negative prompt for stable diffusion to generate an image of the scene using the input QR code image, without changing the grid layout of the QR code so that it can still be functionally scanned. The colours of each square can be changed in order to create the scene, however the QR MUST still readable by devices and represent the same data as the base. The prompt and negative prompt are to be concise and to the point with each point separated by commas. The prompt is at some point to include the following: "sports, in the style of Stanley Artgerm, artstation, qr code". The negative prompt is to include "ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame, bad anatomy, watermark, signature, cut off, low contrast, underexposed, overexposed, bad art, beginner, amateur, distorted face, blurry, draft, grainy"

When I send you a description, you will not respond with any other text or information other than the prompt and negative prompt labeled so with a preceding "Prompt: " and "Negative prompt:" with clear paragraph between the end of the prompt and the beginning of the negative prompt.
